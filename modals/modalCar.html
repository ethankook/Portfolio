      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A fully autonomous robot built to navigate tracks of varying complexity using analog photoresistor input and PID feedback control. The robot was tuned for performance across multiple competition scenarios including loops, drag races, and obstacle-heavy tracks.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dynamic PID tuning through potentiometers</li>
        <li>Adjustable base speed for terrain/track specific performance</li>
        <li>LED underglow for sensor stabilization and visibility</li>
        <li>3D modeled chassis(Onshape) and custom-soldered protoboards</li>
        
      </ul>
  
      <p><strong>Technology Used:</strong> Arduino, C++, analog sensors, soldering tools, motor drivers, signal debugging with multimeters and oscilloscopes</p>
  
      <p><strong>Process:</strong> Initial builds focused on chassis stability and signal fidelity from sensors. Iterative testing led to multiple board redesigns to improve light detection accuracy. PID parameters were fine-tuned based on track types. LEDs were added to ensure consistent lighting. Components were secured with hot glue to prevent disconnection under stress.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Sudden signal loss due to inconsistent lighting, battery voltage drops, and PID instability on sharp curves. Debugging required real-time observation and repeated test loops with adjusted parameters.</p>
