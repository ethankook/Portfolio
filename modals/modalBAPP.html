            <h1>BAPP: A Simple Budgeting App</h1>
            <h2>In Progress...</h2>
            <p><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Managing personal finances can be overwhelming, especially for students and young professionals. We wanted to build a simple, intuitive tool that helps users visualize their spending and build better money habits—no spreadsheets or bank account connections required.</p>
        
            <p><strong>What it does:</strong> BAPP is a lightweight budgeting app where users can set a total budget and allocate spending across custom categories (e.g., groceries, rent, entertainment). Through a clean dashboard and modal-based editing system, users can easily track their expenses and remaining funds in each category.</p>
        
            <p><strong>How we built it:</strong> The backend is built with <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and uses <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> to store budget data. The frontend is developed with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong> for a responsive, accessible user experience. We prioritized usability and left out account integration to keep the app lean and immediately functional.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> We faced challenges designing a modal system that felt smooth and non-intrusive while ensuring backend data remained consistent. Synchronizing real-time data between components also required thoughtful state management and API handling.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Accomplishments:</strong> We're proud of delivering a full-stack app with clean design, smooth interactions, and modular code. It’s something we actually find useful ourselves, and we kept the codebase organized for future growth.</p>
        
            <p><strong>What we learned:</strong> We gained experience building full-stack applications from scratch, integrating <strong>React</strong> with <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, and designing maintainable state and modal flows. We also learned how to convert user needs into clear, actionable features within a tight development timeline.</p>
        
            <p><strong>What’s next:</strong> We plan to add persistent sessions, recurring budget support, visualizations (like pie charts and progress bars), CSV export, mobile responsiveness, and secure authentication for personalized tracking.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Built With:</strong> Java, Spring Boot, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL</p>
