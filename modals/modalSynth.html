      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> A powerful digital audio synthesizer developed in MATLAB, offering users a hands-on interface to explore sound generation, manipulation, and effects processing. The app allows real-time waveform generation, audio transformation, and visualization within an intuitive GUI.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generation of sine, square, sawtooth, triangle, and ECG waveforms</li>
        <li>Audio effects: echo, reverb, chorus, flanger, distortion, delay, muffled</li>
        <li>Volume, pitch, and speed controls</li>
        <li>Real-time FFT visualization and signal playback</li>
        <li>Envelope shaping and white noise synthesis</li>
        <li>Interactive GUI for all controls using MATLAB App Designer</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p><strong>Technology Used:</strong> MATLAB, MATLAB App Designer, Audio Toolbox</p>
  
      <p><strong>Process:</strong> The project began with core waveform functions and expanded into a full interface. Each audio effect was modularly designed and chained using internal signal flow logic. Visual elements such as spectrum analyzers and time plots were created for user interaction and feedback.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Handling overlapping effects without signal clipping, managing GUI state transitions, and ensuring responsiveness in real-time audio processing.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Accomplishments:</strong> A polished and flexible synthesis tool capable of both educational use and creative sound design. Achieved a robust real-time interface with interactive controls and audio output.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Applications:</strong> DSP education, sound design experimentation, signal chain prototyping, and audio effect testing.</p>
