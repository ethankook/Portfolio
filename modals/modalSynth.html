      <h1>Digital Audio Synthesizer</h1>
      <h2>Completed</h2>
  
      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This synthesizer is a fully interactive digital audio workstation built in MATLAB using the Audio Toolbox. It allows users to generate, manipulate, and visualize audio signals with various effects and transformations through a clean, GUI-based interface. The synthesizer supports waveform generation, sound modification, signal visualization, and audio playback.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Key Features:</strong> Users can choose from predefined signals or upload audio files, apply filters and effects, and view signal changes in both the time and frequency domains. The interface supports dynamic controls like sliders, knobs, dropdown menus, and buttons to activate effects in real time.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Functionality Includes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Waveform generation (sine, cosine, triangle, square, sawtooth)</li>
        <li>Volume, pitch, and speed adjustment</li>
        <li>Amplitude modulation, frequency shifting, and envelope shaping</li>
        <li>Audio effects: delay, reverb, flanger, chorus, echo, muffled, distortion</li>
        <li>Filtering: bandpass, bandstop, and frequency enhancement</li>
        <li>Signal mixing and convolution</li>
        <li>ECG waveform and heartbeat signal synthesis</li>
        <li>Melody generation and white noise creation</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p><strong>Engineering Tools & Skills Used:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MATLAB</strong> — primary development environment</li>
        <li><strong>MATLAB App Designer</strong> (`.mlapp`) — GUI construction</li>
        <li><strong>Audio Toolbox</strong> — pitch shifting, convolution, reverb, playback</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Signal Processing</strong> — time/frequency domain transformations, filtering, sampling</li>
        <li><strong>Fourier Analysis</strong> — used to generate and analyze frequency responses</li>
        <li><strong>Convolution</strong> — audio blending and effect application</li>
        <li><strong>Modulation Techniques</strong> — amplitude modulation, additive synthesis</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p><strong>Workflow:</strong> Users load or select an audio file, apply desired effects through the GUI, and visualize the waveform updates on graphs. They can switch between modified and original signals and interactively explore the impact of filters and transformations using real-time playback.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Applications:</strong> This synthesizer serves as a modular platform for music production, audio experimentation, and signal analysis. It is also suitable for rapid prototyping of audio effects or sound-based interfaces, offering hands-on exposure to core DSP techniques and sound engineering workflows.</p>
